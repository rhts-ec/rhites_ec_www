Over a period of 6 months (April – September 2019) data of the BABIES matrix shows that 44.5% (204) of the 458 perinatal deaths were fresh still births (FSBs) while macerated stillbirths (MSB) and early neonatal deaths contributed 36.9% and 18.6% respectively. MSBs and FSBs were highest in in >2,500g weight babies while early neonatal deaths were highest in the 1,500 – 2,499g weight babies. High still birth rate among >2500g point to the gaps in the quality of care during late pregnancy and labour and delivery process that the women who delivered within the April – Sep 2019 period while the high early neonatal deaths within the >2,499g babies point to gaps in essential newborn care, resuscitation newborn and management of the sick newborn.
