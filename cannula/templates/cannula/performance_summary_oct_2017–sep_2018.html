The project will continue to support HMIS focal persons and facility MPDSR teams to do Zero reporting (in case of no death), review deaths and harmonize reports from MPDSR committees and those submitted by HMIS officers. In Q4 of PY2, verbal autopsies were carried out in the districts of Luuka and Namutumba where no institutional maternal deaths have been reported for a long time but with community report by VHTs on maternal deaths. In Mayuge, verbal autopsies and community dialogues were as initiated in Q3. We will support facility teams and districts to scale up community interventions in FY19.</td>
