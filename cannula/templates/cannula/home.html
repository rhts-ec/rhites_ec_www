                        <p>We are a health technical assistance project with a cutting edge performance and monitoring platform.
                                Our flagship performance database (RHITESEC-DB) is a cutting-edge platform used to process
                                project-required data obtained from the mainstream health information system (DHIS2)
                                and other supplementary sources; and create user-centric data sets, dashboards and real-time reports
                                                that facilitate data utilization from project inception to current time. </p>

                        <p>
                                Using open-source software, we continually innovate cloud-based and custom-designed collection tools to capture, process
                                and analyze relevant and real-time data from resource-constrained environments, using one
                                of the most commonly used device in Uganda - an Android phone. This data can be accessed
                                24/7 from anywhere, by the users.

                                A performance measurement platform for evidence-based and data-driven decision making, this database enables users to optimize
                                outcomes for program key performance indicators, adapt and scale-up good practices to ensure
                                cost-effectiveness, accountability and transparency in decision making.
